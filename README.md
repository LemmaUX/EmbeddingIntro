# Advanced Embeddings and Deep Neural Networks: Transforming Text into Structured Data

This project combines embeddings from **Word2Vec**, **GloVe**, and **Transformers** (BERT/GPT-3) with a custom deep neural network to transform unstructured text into high-quality, structured data. The notebook demonstrates how these techniques can be used for **semantic analysis**, **classification**, **recommendations**, **visualizations**, and **temporal predictions**. Each section includes theoretical insights into the models and their practical implementations.

## Project Structure

### 1. **Import Required Libraries**
We begin by importing necessary libraries such as `numpy`, `pandas`, `spacy`, `gensim`, `torch`, and `transformers` for model handling, data processing, and embedding generation.

### 2. **Load and Preprocess Data**
The notebook loads a custom dataset and preprocesses it for embedding generation. This step involves:
- Tokenizing text
- Removing stopwords and special characters
- Lowercasing

### 3. **Generate Custom Embeddings**
We generate embeddings from various models, each capturing different aspects of text:

#### 3.1 **Word2Vec Embeddings**
Using `gensim` to train or load pre-trained Word2Vec models, we convert text into fixed-size, dense vectors based on local context.

#### 3.2 **GloVe Embeddings**
Pre-trained GloVe embeddings are loaded to capture global statistical relationships in words. The embedding vectors are combined with Word2Vec vectors to enrich our representations.

#### 3.3 **Transformer Embeddings (BERT/GPT-3)**
Using the `transformers` library, we integrate BERT or GPT-3 embeddings that capture contextual relationships between words and phrases in a sentence, enabling more powerful semantic understanding.

### 4. **Combine Embeddings**
We create a hybrid embedding model by combining Word2Vec, GloVe, and Transformer embeddings into a single vector representation. This provides the best of both traditional and contextual embedding techniques.

### 5. **Build Deep Neural Network**
The combined embeddings are fed into a deep neural network for semantic analysis tasks. This network utilizes state-of-the-art architectures and optimization strategies.

#### 5.1 **Integrate Contextual and Traditional Embeddings**
The neural network takes as input both pre-trained contextual embeddings (e.g., BERT) and traditional embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec), allowing it to adapt to various text types and structures.

#### 5.2 **Define Network Architecture**
The architecture of the deep neural network is designed to efficiently handle embeddings of varying dimensions. It includes several dense layers, dropout for regularization, and batch normalization to improve convergence.

#### 5.3 **Train the Model**
We train the model on the dataset, using different optimization algorithms such as **AdamW**, **RMSProp**, and **LARS** for better training stability and performance.

#### 5.4 **Dynamic Embedding Fine-Tuning**
The embeddings are fine-tuned dynamically during training, allowing the model to adapt to domain-specific language and improve contextual understanding.

### 6. **Semantic Analysis Tasks**
The model performs several high-level tasks related to text classification and anomaly detection:

#### 6.1 **Hierarchical Classification**
We use the model to categorize text into a multi-level taxonomy of topics, helping classify complex documents such as academic papers, blog posts, or product descriptions.

#### 6.2 **Anomaly Detection**
The model detects outliers and unusual patterns in text, useful for tasks like fraud detection or identifying rare topics in datasets.

### 7. **Visualize Embeddings with Self-Organizing Maps (SOM)**
To gain insights into the structure of our embeddings, we use **Self-Organizing Maps (SOM)**. This unsupervised learning technique groups similar embeddings together and visualizes them in a 2D space.

#### 7.1 **Generate 2D Interactive Map**
We generate a 2D interactive map of embeddings using **Plotly/Dash**, allowing for easy exploration of the relationships between the embeddings.

#### 7.2 **Visualize Relationships with Plotly/Dash**
In addition to SOM visualizations, we present embeddings and their relationships interactively with **Plotly** for better exploration.

### 8. **Recommendation System**
We build a recommendation system based on **cosine similarity** and **cross-entropy loss**, with an added **k-nearest neighbors** approach to suggest related items.

#### 8.1 **Cosine Similarity**
Cosine similarity is used to calculate the semantic similarity between text items, helping identify products, documents, or content with similar meaning.

#### 8.2 **Cross-Entropy and k-Nearest Neighbors**
To refine the recommendation system, we also use cross-entropy loss and a k-nearest neighbors algorithm for better accuracy in similarity-based recommendations.

#### 8.3 **User Preference Customization**
The recommendation system allows users to adjust the temperature of the recommendations, switching between exploration and exploitation modes.

### 9. **Model Interpretation**
We incorporate model interpretation tools to better understand the decision-making process of our neural network.

#### 9.1 **SHAP Analysis**
SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values are used to understand the contribution of each feature (embedding) to the modelâ€™s predictions.

#### 9.2 **LIME Analysis**
LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) helps explain individual predictions, providing insights into how the model makes its decisions at a local level.

#### 9.3 **Dynamic Bar Charts and Heatmaps**
We visualize the results of SHAP and LIME with interactive bar charts and heatmaps using **matplotlib** and **seaborn**.

### 10. **Temporal Prediction Model**
Using temporal text data, we create a model that predicts the evolution of semantic trends over time.

#### 10.1 **Predict Semantic Trends**
The model predicts how certain terms or topics will evolve in relevance, aiding in trend forecasting.

#### 10.2 **Time Series Analysis with Text and Embeddings**
We apply time series analysis techniques to embeddings, using historical text data to predict future trends or behaviors.

### 11. **Self-Learning Component**
The model incorporates a self-learning mechanism, which allows it to adapt over time by incorporating real-time user feedback.

#### 11.1 **Real-Time User Feedback Integration**
The system uses **RNNs** or **Transformers** to incorporate feedback from users into the model, allowing it to continuously improve its predictions and recommendations.

### 12. **Interactive Test Scenario**
We create an interactive test scenario that allows users to upload custom text data, generate embeddings, classify text, recommend related information, and visualize relationships in real-time.
